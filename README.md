# Entropy Decoding in WebGL

This directory contains a simple demo website that runs an entropy coder on the client's GPU using WebGL.
To test it, open a terminal `cd` into this directory, and execute

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then, point your web browser to the URL that is printed to the terminal (usually <http://0.0.0.0:8000/>).
